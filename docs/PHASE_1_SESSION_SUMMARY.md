## 📌 TECHNICAL NOTES

### **Architecture Decisions:**
1. **Soft Delete** - Cancelled appointments stay in DB
2. **Hard Delete** - Delete button removes permanently
3. **Reload Pattern** - Always reload after mutations
4. **Sync Queue** - All changes queued with priority 3
5. **Error Handling** - Try/catch with user-facing messages

### **Database Operations:**
- `appointmentsDB.delete(id)` - Hard delete
- `appointmentsDB.getById(id)` - Fetch single
- `appointmentsDB.getByDate(salonId, date)` - Fetch by date
- `saveAppointment(updated)` - Update existing

### **Redux Actions:**
- `updateLocalAppointment({ id, updates })` - Update
- `addLocalAppointment(appointment)` - Reload/refresh

### **Sync Operations:**
- `syncService.queueUpdate('appointment', data, 3)` - Queue update
- `syncService.queueDelete('appointment', id, 3)` - Queue deletion

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### **What's Better:**
1. **Delete Button** - Clear, visible, but styled safely (gray)
2. **Confirmation Dialogs** - Show appointment details before delete
3. **Success Toasts** - Immediate feedback on all actions
4. **Auto-Close Modals** - Clean UX after save
5. **Calendar Refresh** - See changes immediately

### **User Flow:**
```
View Appointment → Click Edit → Modify → Save → See Changes
View Appointment → Click Delete → Confirm → Removed
View Appointment → Click Cancel → Cancelled (soft delete)
View Appointment → Click No Show → Marked
```

---

## 🔒 DATA INTEGRITY

### **Guarantees:**
- ✅ All mutations write to IndexedDB first
- ✅ Redux updated optimistically
- ✅ Sync queue tracks all changes
- ✅ Reload ensures consistency
- ✅ Confirmations prevent accidents
- ✅ Soft delete preserves history

### **Race Conditions Prevented:**
- Edit + Delete → Delete wins (modal closes)
- Multiple edits → Last write wins
- Create + Delete → Both queued in order

---

## 📈 METRICS & PERFORMANCE
