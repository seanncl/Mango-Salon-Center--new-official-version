## üé® Design Principles

All components follow the existing Mango POS design system:

### Colors:
- **Primary (Teal/Cyan)**: Staff management, primary actions
- **Blue**: Service-related features
- **Green**: Checkout, payments, success states
- **Amber**: Wait list, warnings
- **Red**: Discounts, deletions

### UI Patterns:
- **Gradient backgrounds**: Headers and primary buttons
- **Rounded corners**: 12-16px (xl) for cards, 8-10px (lg) for inputs
- **Shadows**: Subtle elevation for cards and modals
- **Transitions**: Smooth hover and state changes
- **Icons**: Lucide React icons throughout

## üîß Integration Points

### Redux Store Integration:
```typescript
// Staff Management
import { staffSlice } from './store/slices/staffSlice';

// Ticket Management
import { ticketsSlice } from './store/slices/ticketsSlice';

// Dispatch actions
dispatch(addStaff(newStaff));
dispatch(assignStaffToService({ ticketId, serviceIndex, staffId }));
dispatch(completeCheckout({ ticketId, payments, tip, discount }));
```

### API Endpoints Needed:
```typescript
// Staff
POST   /api/staff              // Create staff
PUT    /api/staff/:id          // Update staff
DELETE /api/staff/:id          // Delete staff
GET    /api/staff              // List all staff
GET    /api/staff/:id          // Get staff details

// Tickets
POST   /api/tickets/:id/assign-staff    // Assign staff to service
POST   /api/tickets/:id/checkout        // Process checkout

// Payments
