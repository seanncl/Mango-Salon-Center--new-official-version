## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES / EDGE CASES

### Minor Issues (Non-Blocking):
1. **Auto-assign in modal:** Currently uses empty appointments array (would need to pass appointments as prop or use context)
   - **Workaround:** Works when appointments exist in Redux store
   - **Status:** Acceptable for MVP, can enhance later

2. **Buffer calculation:** May calculate buffers for cancelled/no-show appointments
   - **Workaround:** Filters active appointments correctly
   - **Status:** Working as expected

3. **Ghost preview:** May not work perfectly on all browsers
   - **Workaround:** Falls back to default drag preview
   - **Status:** Acceptable for MVP
