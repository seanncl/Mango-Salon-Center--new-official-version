    // ... other reducers
  }
});
```

### Step 2: Connect to Existing Ticket Flow
```typescript
// In your ticket management component
import { MultiStaffAssignment } from './components/TicketManagement/MultiStaffAssignment';
import { QuickCheckout } from './components/Checkout/QuickCheckout';

// Add staff assignment before moving to "In Service"
// Add checkout when service is complete
```

### Step 3: Add Navigation
```typescript
// Add Staff Management to your navigation/menu
<Link to="/staff">Staff Management</Link>
```

### Step 4: API Integration

- `onEditStaff` ‚Üí PUT /api/staff/:id
- `onDeleteStaff` ‚Üí DELETE /api/staff/:id
- `onAssignStaff` ‚Üí POST /api/tickets/:id/assign-staff
