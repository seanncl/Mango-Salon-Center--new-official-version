### Typography
```typescript
const typography = {
  h1: 'text-3xl font-bold',      // Page titles (30px)
  h2: 'text-2xl font-semibold',  // Section headers (24px)
  h3: 'text-xl font-medium',     // Subsection headers (20px)
  body: 'text-base',             // Body text (16px)
  small: 'text-sm',              // Secondary text (14px)
  caption: 'text-xs',            // Captions (12px)
}
```

### Component Patterns
- **Cards:** Elevated with shadow (shadow-lg), rounded corners (rounded-lg)
- **Buttons:** Primary (solid, orange), Secondary (outline), Tertiary (text)
- **Modals:** Centered, backdrop blur, slide animation
- **Forms:** Clear labels, helpful placeholders, inline validation
- **Lists:** Spacious (py-3), clear separators (border-b), hover states

### Animation Principles
- **Smooth:** 60fps, use CSS transforms
- **Purposeful:** Every animation has a purpose
- **Fast:** Short durations (150-300ms)
- **Natural:** Ease-in-out curves
